# Project Init

Initialize any project with MindContext methodology through conversational discovery.

This command will:
1. Create `.project/` directory structure
2. Generate `CLAUDE.md` with project guidelines
3. Walk through project discovery questions
4. Create `.project/design.md` with vision and roadmap
5. Suggest first PRD to create

Works for both:
- **Greenfield** - New projects (full 7-question discovery)
- **Brownfield** - Existing codebases (lighter 5-question flow)

Invoke the project-init skill for guided setup.
