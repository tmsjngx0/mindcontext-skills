## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.1] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed
- **Skill wording clarity** - Corrected language in 4 skills to clarify that main Claude agent spawns subagents, not the skills themselves
  - `task-workflow` - Changed "Invoke developer-agent" to "When main Claude agent spawns developer-agent"
  - `tdd-workflow` - Changed "Invoke developer-agent" to "When main Claude agent spawns developer-agent"
  - `task-start` - Changed "Invoke developer-agent" to "When main Claude agent spawns developer-agent"
  - `epic-start` - Removed "launching parallel agents" language, clarified main agent spawns developer-agents

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- **epic-create skill** - Convert PRD to technical Epic (completes PRD → Epic → Tasks workflow)
- **focus-state skill** - Manage current work focus (epic/issue/branch tracking)
- **State management** - `config.json` and `.project/state/focus.json` for project configuration
- **Workflow commands (5 new)** - `/prd`, `/epic`, `/plan`, `/focus`, `/next`

### Removed
- **entity-manage skill** - Violated architecture (skills cannot spawn agents)
- **Analysis commands (6 removed)** - `/analyze`, `/debug`, `/find`, `/review`, `/trace`, `/security`
  - Use natural language instead: "analyze this code", "debug this error", etc.
  - Main Claude agent routes to correct subagent automatically

### Changed
- **Commands simplified** - From 11 to 10 workflow-focused commands
- **project-scaffold skill** - Now creates `.project/state/` directory and state files
- **README** - Updated skill table, added commands section, clarified natural language usage
- **Total skills: 23** (21 existing + 2 new - 1 removed)

### Fixed
- **Architecture compliance** - No skills spawn agents (per official Claude Code docs)
- **Workflow gap** - PRD → Epic conversion now works via epic-create skill
