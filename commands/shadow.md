# Shadow Engineering Setup

Set up the Shadow Engineering pattern for clean git history and professional output.

**Shadow Engineering** separates AI orchestration (messy, iterative) from production code (clean, contribution-ready):

```
Shadow (Parent)              Light (Submodule)
├── .project/         →      ├── src/
├── AI context        →      ├── tests/
├── FlowForge         →      └── Clean commits
└── Orchestration
```

This skill will:
1. Create parent orchestration repository
2. Initialize FlowForge structure
3. Set up production code as submodule
4. Configure clean commit workflow
5. Separate AI artifacts from deliverable code

Benefits:
✅ Clean git history (no AI artifacts)
✅ Professional commits
✅ Contribution-ready code
✅ Context isolation
✅ Team-friendly workflow
